# Approximate Dynamic Programming for Shared Transportation of Passenger and Cargo

## Description

This project includes eight modules for the main simulation: `train_timetable_S1_function`, `class_train_functions`, `class_simulator`, `class_policy`, `class_passenger_init_load-data`, `class_cargo_request`, and `class_revenue_results`.

## Usage

To run different simulations and output data for various research goals, use the following files:
- `medium_intensity_selection`
- `policy_selection`
- `sensitivity_selection`

To calculate sample average results of simulation runs, use:
- `calculate_avg_revenue_from_csv`
- `calculate_avg_train_load_from_csv`

To visualize the results, use the remaining plot modules.
